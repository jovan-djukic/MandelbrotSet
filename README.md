# Mandelbrot Set 
This repository contains an implementation of a program used to visualize the Mandelbrot set.
Implementation also contains a "Pan and Zoom" camera which can be used to move around.

If you choose to use maven you also need to download the dependencies (also using maven) and do not forget to include them in the classpath.
